# ECE-128-Lab-8
The purpose of this lab is to design and implement a Random Access Memory (RAM) module capable of reading and writing 8-bit wide data across 8 distinct memory locations. In addition, a Read Only Memory (ROM) module will store 4-bit wide data across 8 predefined memory locations. Both designs will be verified through simulation using Verilog in Vivado.
